## Alessandro Noiato

I am an ambitious and curious Full Stack Junior Developer, looking for a role to expand my programming knowledge while gaining exposure to other aspects of Web Technologies and Computer Science. 

After graduating in Mathematics from the University of Padua, I spent some time working in the consulting industry as an ERP Functional Analyst - a consultant in charge of providing technological solution to business problems.

## Skills

#### Analytical thinker

A degree in Mathematics both requires and sharpens analytical thinking at the highest level. In particular, my strengths lie in having a quick understanding of problem-solving tools, why they are necessary and how they are employed in a particular context. I earned my position at Deloitte by acing their analytical thinking aptitude test and later I applied my skills by working on a team that helped a major player in fashion and apparel upgrade their ERP software company-wide.  

#### Excellent communicator

The aforementioned project entailed working closely with key employees of the client in order to understand the company's processes and determine how to customize the software we sold to better suit their needs. I would then work closely with the developers - both internal and internationally outsourced - to ensure they were building the right product and help them test it and debug it. These development cycles entailed coordinating what were in effect intrinsically different, completely separated groups of people and it incessantly tested my communication and collaboration skills.

#### Fast, independent learner

During my time at Deloitte I had to master very quickly the structure of a well known, complex ERP software (Microsoft Dynamics AX) and acquaint myself with its proprietary development environment - MorphX. During my time at Makers I learned several new technologies in a short time span. As a weekend challenge, I wrote [a basic C app to send HTTP requests](https://github.com/terminalobject/HTTP-Request-in-C). This required getting acquainted with the basics of Berkeley Sockets and the C language over a couple of days. As a final project for graduation from Makers, we developed a Machine Learning app for headline filtering. 

#### Great Collaborator

Makers Academy focuses also on improving the collaboration skills of its graduates by incorporating pair programming and group projects into its daily routines. As part of a team of 5, I developed a [Pong game in vanilla JavaScript](https://github.com/tbscanlon/ping-js) in one week. 

## Projects

Title   | Timeframe  | Description
-- | -- | --
[Pong game](https://github.com/tbscanlon/ping-js) | 1 Week | A pong game app written in pure javascript using no frameworks or testing libraries. My main responsibility for this project was developing the code to handle collisions between the objects involved in the game.
[HTTP requests](https://github.com/terminalobject/HTTP-Request-in-C) | 2 days | A simple app that sends HTTP requests. Learning the basics of a language like C has great value in the context of this bootcamp because it is radically different from the ones usually taught at Makers and sheds some light on the relationship between code and hardware. Similarly, learning a few notions about Berkeley sockets allowed me to take a peek at the complexity behind "basic" browser features.
[Perceptron](https://github.com/terminalobject/perceptron) | 2 weeks | A headling filtering app written entirely in Ruby without using any library. Tested using Rspec. This app makes use of a Perceptron algorithm to find a decision boundary between "good" and "bad" headlines (conveniently translated into vectors that track some of their features). The perceptron algorithm was then built into a [gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/perceptron), available to the Ruby community.
